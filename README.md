# Scientific-Computing-and-Numerical-Examples
This repository comprises three programs written in C#, each tackling distinct scientific computing topics and algorithms.

The Programs are are follows:

Assignment 1: Implement Elementary Cellular Automata in C# using bitwise operators

Assignment 2: Implementing a Perceptron in C# that fits to the data in the file 'data.csv'

Assignment 3: SIR-runga-kutta.cs - Solves the SIR equations using the 4th order runga kutta method implimeted from scratch

Assignment 4:Gauss-Jacobi Solver.cs - Implimentes the Gauss-Jacobi iterative solver
